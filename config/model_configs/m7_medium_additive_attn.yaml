  # Attention configuration
  attention: "additive"     # Bahdanau: score_ij = v^T * tanh(W * h_i + U * h_j)
  attention_size: 128       # Dimension of attention layer

training:
  learning_rate: 0.0005    # Paper used 0.0005 for larger models
  dropout: 0.0             # Ablation: test without dropout
  early_stopping:
    patience: 5            # Faster convergence without dropout

attention:
  enabled: true             # Save attention weights during training
