# M1: Small Baseline LSTM (WITH DROPOUT - Ablation Study)
# Expected parameters: ~340K
# Expected training time: ~2h

model:
  name: "M1_Small_Baseline_Dropout"
  type: "baseline"          # baseline | simple_attention | additive_attention | scaled_dp_attention

  # Architecture
  input_size: 5             # Number of input features
  hidden_size: 64
  num_layers: 3
  output_size: 1            # Predict single value

  # Attention (not used for baseline)
  attention: null

# Training overrides (optional - inherits from base_config.yaml)
training:
  learning_rate: 0.001
  dropout: 0.2              # Ablation: test with dropout
  early_stopping:
    patience: 15            # More patience needed with dropout
