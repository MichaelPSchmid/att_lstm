  # Attention configuration
  attention: "simple"      # score_i = W * h_i + b (independent per timestep)

training:
  learning_rate: 0.0005    # Paper used 0.0005 for larger models
  dropout: 0.2             # Regularization for larger model
  early_stopping:
    patience: 15           # More patience with dropout

attention:
  enabled: true             # Save attention weights during training
