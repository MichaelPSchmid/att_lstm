  output_size: 1

  # Attention configuration
  attention: "scaled_dot_product"  # Transformer-style: score_ij = (h_i · h_j) / sqrt(d)

training:
  learning_rate: 0.0005    # Paper used 0.0005 for larger models
  dropout: 0.2             # Regularization for larger model
  early_stopping:
    patience: 15           # More patience with dropout

attention:
  enabled: true             # Save attention weights during training
